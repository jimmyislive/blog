Some of the books I have recently read. Hopefully you will find them enjoyable. 
* [The Circadian Code - Satchin Panda](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BVF1Z6Z/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)

    >A very revealing book about all the biological clocks in your body and how they work, which has a direct effect on your overall health. Anecdotally, I can confirm several of my suspicions related to my health after reading this book e.g. bad sleeping habits which sometimes made me feel tired even after waking up in the morn. This book does a good job of revealing the science behind the way our body clocks work and how with relatively simple changes in our schedule / habits we can make vast improvements in health. Will be trying out several of the recommendations in this book.

* [Tender Bar - J. R Moehringer](https://www.amazon.com/Tender-Bar-J-R-Moehringer/dp/0786888768)
    
    >One of the best books I have read. It's a memoir of J. R Moehringer. Beautifully written. Found it very hard to put this book down !

* [The Billionaire Raj - James Crabtree](https://www.amazon.com/Billionaire-Raj-Journey-Through-Indias/dp/1524760064)

    >All about the corruption / crony capitalism in India. A sad state of affiars indeed. To most folks born and raised in India though, it's nothing new. But to see it defining the future of the country is depressing. 

* [Death by Food Pyramid - Denise Minger](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0984755128/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

    >An insightful and well researched book about the politics of nutrition. Being healthy today has become confusing owing to the contradictory information coming out of various institutions. Not to mention how special interests and lobbyists of the food industry hijack the health agenda with flimsy science. Read this book, do your own research and make decisions about your health !

* [Shoe Dog - Phil Knight](https://www.amazon.com/Shoe-Dog-Memoir-Creator-Nike-ebook/dp/B0176M1A44)

    >Memoir of the creator of Nike. Great stroy of grit and passion. Essential reading for any entrepreneur. (Incidently, it was ghost written by J. R Moehringer)

* [Sapiens - Yuval Noah Harari](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062316095/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

    >Great read about the history of mankind. He goes through a chronological sequence of historical events starting from the early agricultutal era to the present one. Intutive insights into why we are the way we are.

* [The Checklist Manifesto - Atul Gawande](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312430000/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

    >I started making checkists after reading this book !

* [When Breadth Becomes Air - Paul Kalanithi](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1784701998/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

    >Poignant read about the fragility of life.
