Depending on the type of job you are applying to e.g. individual contributor, mgmt etc coding interviews are a fact of life. They are also table stakes. Blow it and it's unlikely to result in a favourable outcome. This post is not about if you need them or not or if they are the right way to assess coding proficieny. (Thats a whle different topic). This post is about HOW its done today.

Almost 99.99% of them are done with a sevior IC at the other end pasting a problem on some IDE and then you solving it. All the time they are just...watching ! Not sure about anyone else, but that is just so distracting. The common excuse is "we want to hear the way you think", "talk out aloud". I don't really buy any of that. 

As a developer, it's extremely distracting to feel someone gazing over you while you are coding. You seldom do this is real life. You could also just as easily write out the algo you are about to follow before coding it to address the "we want to hear the way you think" concern.

**A Better Way**

Here are some options I propose for companies to adopt:

* A take home assignment

I love these as candidates can work on their own time in a much more relaxed environment. The caveat here is that it probably needs to be a much more beefier assignment. The pros though are you can see how the canadidate follows instructions, how they package the submission, if they write unit tests etc etc There are a number of vectors across which you can evaluate

* Provide the problem statement and then leave

If you insist on a codign exercise, provide the problem statement, hang around for a bit in case the candidate has some clarifying questions...then leave !
