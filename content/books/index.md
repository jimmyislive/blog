Some of the books I have recently read. Hopefully you will find them enjoyable. 

* [Tender Bar - J. R Moehringer](https://www.amazon.com/Tender-Bar-J-R-Moehringer/dp/0786888768)
    
    >One of the best books I have read. It's a memoir of J. R Moehringer. Beautifully written. Found it very hard to put this book down !

* [The Billionaire Raj - James Crabtree](https://www.amazon.com/Billionaire-Raj-Journey-Through-Indias/dp/1524760064)

    >All about the corruption / crony capitalism in India. A sad state of affiars indeed. To most folks born and raised in India though, it's nothing new. But to see it defining the future of the country is depressing. 

* [Death by Food Pyramid - Denise Minger](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0984755128/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

    >An insightful and well researched book about the politics of nutrition. Being healthy today has become confusing owing to the contradictory information coming out of various institutions. Not to mention how special interests and lobbyists of the food industry hijack the health agenda with flimsy science. Read this book, do your own research and make decisions about your health !

* [Shoe Dog - Phil Knight](https://www.amazon.com/Shoe-Dog-Memoir-Creator-Nike-ebook/dp/B0176M1A44)
