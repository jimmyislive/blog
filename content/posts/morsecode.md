Recently I learnt morse code. It was pretty easy to translate characters to dot/dashes (it took me under a day). I then wrote a Go program to translate text to morse code and back.

If anyone wants to play with it, it is available at [text2morse.jimmyislive.dev](https://text2morse.jimmyislive.dev)

The site is hosted by Netlify and the backend is built using [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [api-gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) and [aws lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

Enjoy !
