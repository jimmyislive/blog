I don't think we understand rates of change very well.

The reason AI is all the rage now is that it offers an opportunity for a gigantic leap in the `rate of change` of innovation. No one can say what it will usher in. But it seems like an ideal vehicle to bring about this big change. 

Big rates of change is what brings about disruptions and opportunities. The big players can't possibly address them all. That's where opportunities (and entrepreneurs and VCs) step in. The chance of doing something better, faster and/or cheaper. 

It's not very often that a technology comes along with so many possibilities such as AI. It may be years before someone actually comes up with a product with a viable business model. But that's besides the point. It's the possibilities with this rate of change that excites technologists. The rate of change will start slowly and then all at once !

Most will not even see it coming. You will realize it only when you look backwards and see how much change has already happened. 

However, just being aware of it can be very insightful. Imagine if you were at the beginning of the mobile revolution and knew that this was a defining moment in tech. Maybe you would have made some decisions differently. Today we are in such a sea change again with AI/LLMs etc. Maybe it's worthwhile to take a step back and see what this means for you. How can this make you more productive (Or redundant) ?  And what are some actions you can take now, while you are in the midst of it.

Else, like most, you'll be looking backwards with nostalgia, when everything has already passed.
