I love solving coding puzzles in my free time. (probably an old habit I acquired from my [CodeEval](https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/02/hirevue-acquires-codeeval-a-programmer-evaluation-tool-for-recruiters/) days)

Meta has a bunch of them on their [career site](https://www.metacareers.com/profile/coding_puzzles).

If anyone is interested, I'll be solving them and uploading them to [github](https://github.com/jimmyislive/meta_coding_puzzles).
