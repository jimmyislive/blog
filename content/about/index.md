My name is Jimmy and I am engineer / entrepreneur living and working in beautiful [Berkeley, CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley,_California).

My interests revolve around technology, health & nutrition and self-awareness.

In a former life, I founded and sold [CodeEval](https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/02/hirevue-acquires-codeeval-a-programmer-evaluation-tool-for-recruiters/).


I used to have an older blog [here](https://jimmyislive.tumblr.com/). This blog is created via the awesome [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework. It is hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). All the code for this site is available on [Github](https://github.com/jimmyislive/blog).

This is my personal blog. (Views expressed here are my own)
