A while back I created some [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) exercises for my kids. It is modeled as a series of exercises (with solutions) that you/your kids can try as you learn programming. Just put it in the form of a free course: [Scratch for Beginners](https://codervalleyhq.teachable.com/p/scratch-for-beginners). Enjoy!
