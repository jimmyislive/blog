My name is Jimmy and I am engineer / entrepreneur living and working in beautiful [Berkeley, CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley,_California).

I currently work on MLOps / MLInfra / Data Pipelines / Infrastructure Automation / Tooling using AWS/GCP/K8/docker/Golang/Python/Terraform/Airflow etc. If you are looking for a engineering management/leadership hire, hit me up !

My interests revolve around technology, health, philosophy/spirituality and learning.

In a former life, I founded and sold [CodeEval](https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/02/hirevue-acquires-codeeval-a-programmer-evaluation-tool-for-recruiters/).
