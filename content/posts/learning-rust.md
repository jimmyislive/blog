Ive always been curious about the [Rust Programming Language](https://rust-lang.org). It's got some very attractive properties like  memory safety, no GC pauses, being blazingly fast etc. I'm also curious as to how it would perform in AI centric applications like inferencing etc

I'll be using two primary resources for it: [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/) and [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example). The only way to learn anything is by actually trying it. I'll document my journey of sample programs on [github](https://github.com/jimmyislive/rust)

Another very ueful resource is [Rustlings](https://rustlings.rust-lang.org)

In the age of LLMs and coding assistants, one may question the utility of this. But I think, building familiarity and expertiese in something new is absolutely essential, so you can understand better what these coding assistants are churning out. Learning actually becomes easier as Claude / OpenAI etc can explain concepts in very intutive ways. But there is no substitue to gaining expertiese firsthand, so then you can guide an AI assistant to help you solve more complex problems.

I'm now officially a _Rustaceans_ !
