Some of the books I have recently read. Hopefully you will find them enjoyable. 

* [Tender Bar - J. R Moehringer](https://www.amazon.com/Tender-Bar-J-R-Moehringer/dp/0786888768)
    
    >One of the best books I have read. It's a memoir of J. R Moehringer. Beautifully written. Found it very hard to put this book down !

* [The Billionaire Raj - James Crabtree](https://www.amazon.com/Billionaire-Raj-Journey-Through-Indias/dp/1524760064)

    >All about the corruption / crony capitalism in India. A sad state of affiars indeed. To most folks born and raised in India though, it's nothing new. But to see it defining the future of the country is depressing. 

* [Shoe Dog - Phil Knight](https://www.amazon.com/Shoe-Dog-Memoir-Creator-Nike-ebook/dp/B0176M1A44)

    >Memoir of the creator of Nike. Great stroy of grit and passion. Essential reading for any entrepreneur. (Incidently, it was ghost written by J. R Moehringer)
