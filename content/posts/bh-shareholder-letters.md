In case you have not seen it, the Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder Letters are in the [public domain](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html), all the way from 1977! They are a great read about how one of the most iconoic companies in the world is run. Warren Buffett writing style is a mixture of phenomenal insight and humor. A very hard thing to do propely. Here are some gems I came across after reading them:

>The textile industry illustrates in textbook style how producers of relatively undifferentiated goods in capital intensive businesses must earn inadequate returns except under conditions of tight supply or real shortage.

Now replace the "textile industry" with AI and "undifferentiated good" with LLMs ! Eerie similarities !

>We would rather buy 10% of Wonderful Business T at X per share than 100% of T at 2X per share.  Most corporate managers prefer just the reverse, and have no shortage of stated rationales for their behavior.

>During 1981 we came quite close to a major purchase involving both a business and a manager we liked very much. However, the price finally demanded, considering alternative uses for the funds involved, would have left our owners worse off than before the purchase.  The empire would have been larger, but the citizenry would have been poorer.

Compare this sentiment to the prevailing one of insane funding rounds without any product or acquisitions at eye popping numbers with little to no revenue.

*PS: I have not read all the letters, but will update this blog as I read through them with intresting blurbs.*
