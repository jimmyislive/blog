* [The Circadian Code - Satchin Panda](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BVF1Z6Z/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)

    >A very revealing book about all the biological clocks in your body and how they work, which has a direct effect on your overall health. Anecdotally, I can confirm several of my suspicions related to my health after reading this book e.g. bad sleeping habits which sometimes made me feel tired even after waking up in the morn. This book does a good job of revealing the science behind the way our body clocks work and how with relatively simple changes in our schedule / habits we can make vast improvements in health. Will be trying out several of the recommendations in this book.

    >An insightful and well researched book about the politics of nutrition. Being healthy today has become confusing owing to the contradictory information coming out of various institutions. Not to mention how special interests and lobbyists of the food industry hijack the health agenda with flimsy science. Read this book, do your own research and make decisions about your health !
