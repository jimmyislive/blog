I've always been curious about the [Rust Programming Language](https://rust-lang.org). It's got some very attractive properties like  memory safety, no GC pauses and is blazingly fast.

Here are some great resources for learning Rust:

- [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/)
- [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example)
- [Rustlings](https://rustlings.rust-lang.org)


I'll document my journey on [github](https://github.com/jimmyislive/rust)

In the age of LLMs and coding assistants, one may question the utility of this. But I think building familiarity and expertise in something new is absolutely essential, so you can understand better what these coding assistants are churning out. Learning actually becomes easier as Claude / OpenAI etc can explain concepts in very intuitive ways. But there is no substitute to gaining expertise firsthand, so then you can guide an AI assistant to help you solve more complex problems.


Initially, while learning the language, I plan to do it the old fashioned way. Reading up the above resources and trying out sample programs by hand. Once I am sufficiently comfortable with the language, then it just makes more sense to let coding assistants drive and switch to a reviewer role.

I'm now officially a _Rustacean_ !
