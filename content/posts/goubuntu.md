If anyone is looking for a ubuntu based container with [golang 1.13](https://golang.org/doc/go1.13), I just pushed one up to [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com):

`docker pull jimmyislive/goubuntu`

And this container has [vim](https://www.vim.org/) ! (Not sure why many public containers don't have any editor installed on them.)

The Dockerfile used to build this container is available on [Github](https://github.com/jimmyislive/goubuntu)
