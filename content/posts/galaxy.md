We live on a truly magnificent planet. We've got oceans, rivers, mountains, animals, birds...life. No other planet that we know of can sustain life. ([Fermi Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox) anyone ?). We are at just the right distance from the Sun, just the right temperature, just the right atmosphere, just the right...everything. We are truly exceptional !

Turns out though, there is nothing very exceptional about Earth (relatively speaking). We are just one planet amongst many, orbiting around a star (one amognst manay many) within a galaxy (one amongst many many many ...). Just like every other planet, we have a mass, a core, a magnetic field, we rotate around an axis, we have a moon, we orbit around a Star. The cosmos is a very large space. And we are a spec in that ocean of space. A billion years from now, maybe we will become desolate and another one of the planets will start supporting life. It's just nature, doing its thing.

Understanding where we are in the grand scheme of things, helps us in being humble if nothing else. Kudos to the human spirit to constantly find out more about our cosmos though our rovers, rockets, probes, telescopes and even [deflectors](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-confirms-dart-mission-impact-changed-asteroid-s-motion-in-space/) ! 

Here are some numbers I recently learnt about planets that I found very interesting:

# Earth
* Light travels approx at 186K miles/s
* The distance from the earth to the Sun is approx. 92M miles (Also called 1 AU or 1 Astronomical Unit)
* It takes 8.3 minutes for light from the Sun to reach Earth
* The diameter of the earth is 7926 miles
* It rotates around its axis at 1037 miles/h at the equator
* It orbits around the Sun at 66k miles/h 
* The core of the earch is mostly iron, nickle and other radioactive metals.
* The core is quite hot approx 9K degrees F
* The core is surrounded by a molten layer. Owing to the earth's rotation it also flows which results in a magnetic field over earth called the magnetospehere

# Moon
* It is roughly quarter the size of Earth
* Ave distance is 238K miles from earth
* Full Moon: Sun -> Earth -> Moon
* New Moon: Sun -> Moon -> Earth
* You would weigh 1/6th on the moon as its gravitational force is much weaker

# Miscellaneous
* It sometime takes million of years for light emitted by distant starts to reach Earth
* Stars are constantly emitting heat owing to nuclear reactions on its surface
* Outside our solar system is a belt of asteroids made of...ice !
* 

And last but not the least, to begin with astronomy, all you need is to look up with some curiosity. A pair of binuculars would work plenty for starters.
