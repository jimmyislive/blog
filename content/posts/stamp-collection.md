I recently found my old stamp album. It was gifted to me by my aunt in 1986 !

I think back in those days folks were really writing letters to each other. So I could actually collect stamps. Also my aunt was working in some kind of diplomatic service so she would get stamps from many countries I had never heard of. Thus started my hobby.

Somewhere during my teenage years I stopped though. And the album went onto a shelf. My mom found it in some of my old stuff at home and when I went for a vacation she gave it to me. I brought it back with me and then...back it went onto another shelf and then the attic. Several moves, houses and kids later, I found it again while cleaning up some old stuff. 

And here we are. The album seems to have made it a point of constantly being found. So this time i'm going to immortalize it...online. Below i've uploaded images of the stamps I collected as a 10 year old kid.
