Have you ever wondered how folks are using AI ? At work or in their personal lives ? AI is changing faster that anyone can keep up. We constantly hear of flamboyant/pie-in-the-sky use cases. But what about the ways it is being used "right now". Yes it is a great coding and peronal assistant...but "how" exactly are others using it ? Have you ever booked a vacation using AI ? What worked and what did not ? What is your dev setup ?

AI is a tool and it's utility will primarily be determined by how one uses it and for what use cases. In an effort to collect such use cases, I created a GithubPage called [how-we-ai](https://jimmyislive.github.io/how-we-ai/)

It's pretty self-explanatory. If you would like to share what AI workflows you use, read the `Contributing` section. 

I'm looking forward to share and learn from everyone as to where we are headed with AI.
