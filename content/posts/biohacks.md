I recently read a book called "The Gene" (by Siddhartha Mukherjee). It gives a great introduction to the history of our understanding of the human genome. That got me curious and I started playing around with DNA Sequences (in the software world !). I wrote simple functions to do things like DNA transcription, DNA Reverse Complement etc. It is available for anyone to use at:

The backend is AWS Lambda functions. If you are a biochemist or have an interest in the field, do take it for a spin. The hope is to add more utilities over time. If you would like to see something here, feel free to drop me a line.
