In this age of AI generated everything, it is quite useful to understand the origins of content that you are consuming. For media files such as images, videos, audio files etc there is an existing standard [C2PA](https://contentcredentials.org). Digitally signed metadata is attached to it, which can be verified.

However, for text e.g. this blog, it is less mainstream. Browsers don't natively support showing such metadata or verifying content provenance.

In an effort to provide such origin info about the content on this blog, I will be using the following tags:

- Human-Created

    *No AI involved*

- AI-Assisted

    *Human wrote it, AI helped with editing/suggestions/research. Human made final decisions*

- AI-Generated, Reviewed

    *AI wrote the draft, human edited and approved. Human verified accuracy*

- AI-Generated

    *Mostly or entirely AI with minimal human input*

This is a low touch approach to indicate authorship which banks on personal integrity and transparency. 

I would anticipate that most code snippets would fall in the `AI-*` buckets, else it is a missed opportunity. Similarly, textual content would also primarily be `AI-Assisted`. The only `Human-Created` ones would be opinion pieces. Summaries would be an example of useful `AI-Generated` content.

We just need to have a pragmatic approach to AI !
